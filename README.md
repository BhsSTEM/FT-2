# Needed:
# Ability to actually get to the report idle screen
# Way to take in information from the text box
# Creation of like, a report object? That seems like a reasonable way to go about this
# Ability to get all the information into said report object
# And maybe way in the future a way to grab the options from a database instead of a set string

# Needed:
# The text saying "fields" "machines" etc are editable which they shouldn't be
# Way to take in information from the text box
# Creation of like, a report object? That seems like a reasonable way to go about this
# Ability to get all the information into said report object
# And maybe way in the future a way to grab the options from a database instead of a set string
